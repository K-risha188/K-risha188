# About Me
I‚Äôm currently pursuing a degree in **Computer Science and Engineering** with a specialization in **Artificial Intelligence**. Although CSE wasn‚Äôt originally my field of interest, I‚Äôve started taking a genuine interest in it as I learn about new technologies. I‚Äôm excited to explore and learn more in this area as I continue my studies.

I‚Äôm relatively new to GitHub and still learning the basics, but I‚Äôm eager to get involved and start contributing. Right now, I‚Äôm focusing on **Python**, which has become my favorite language to work with, although I‚Äôve also learned **C** and **Java**.

I‚Äôm looking forward to growing my skills and contributing to projects on **GitHub**. Feel free to explore my repositories and don't hesitate to connect if you have any suggestions, feedback, or want to collaborate!
